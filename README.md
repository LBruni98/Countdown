## Introduction
This design document showcases the design, development and implementation of "Countdown", along with the features and mechanics within the game.

#### Brief introduction
This game follows the format of countdown; create an anagram and solve that anagram against the time limit. Longest solved word wins!

#### High-Level Description
Research and implement a video game that mimics the popular show ‘Countdown’. Review, reflect, refactor and evolve the code you designed and developed in Project 003 as a reasonable starting point.

Required language: C#

#### Flowchart

The flowchart showcases the general layout of the countdown game and the features and functions that are planned to be included with the game. Emphasis on the randomization aspect of the game and how the scoring works, where most of the functions match that of project 3.
