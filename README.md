## Introduction
This design document showcases the design, development and implementation of "Countdown", along with the features and mechanics within the game.

#### Brief introduction
This game follows the format of countdown; create an anagram and solve that anagram against the time limit. Longest solved word wins!

#### High-Level Description
Research and implement a video game that mimics the popular show ‘Countdown’. Review, reflect, refactor and evolve the code you designed and developed in Project 003 as a reasonable starting point.

Required language: C#

## Development

#### User Stories
1. As a user, I would like to be shown the main menu
2. As a user, I would like to operate the menus
3. As a user, I want to know how to play the game
4. As a user, I want to be able to start the game
5. As a user, I want to select the letters
6. As a user, I want to know the amount of points my word has
7. As a user, I want to be notified if time runs out
8. As a user, I want to be notified if I win/lose

#### Development Timetable

| 1          | Main Menu                          | 1      | 01/12    |
| 2          | Menu Operation                     | 1      | 02/12    |
| 3          | Help Screen                        | 2      | 02/12    |
| 4          | Starting and loading               | 3      | 04/12    |
| 5          | Letter selection and randomization | 3      | 04/10    |
| 6          | Points for word length             | 3      | 05/10    |
| 7          | Time limit                         | 2      | 06/12    |
| 8          | Winner/Game over screen            | 2      | 06/12    |

#### Use of Teamwork/Communication
The project will be carried out by both Me and Joe

#### Flowchart

The flowchart showcases the general layout of the countdown game and the features and functions that are planned to be included with the game. Emphasis on the randomization aspect of the game and how the scoring works, where most of the functions match that of project 3.

## Creation and Implementation
#### Test Plan
The test plan is uploaded seperately [here.](https://github.com/LBruni98/Countdown/blob/master/Countdown%20Test%20Plan.docx)

##### Evaluation
The testing here was carried out to finding errors that may of come up during the development of the game or other unsightly bugs with this plan also helping out what we may need to do in order to fix each error. What this accomplished was the game actually being more stable as development went on, being that the test plan was more or less used within development after creating the features of the game. This ultimately helped with the development of the game, making it much quicker and seeing more stable game, than risking the testing at the end of development.
